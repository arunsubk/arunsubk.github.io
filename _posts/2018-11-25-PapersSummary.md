    Summary: This paper talks about using data augmentation as a means to avoid a lot of data. Uses CNN of augemnted data. Tests finally of LFW (though clearly doesn't aim at beating the highest accuracies due to unavailablity of commercial achievers' resource details). But asserts it clearly provides an alternative to creating/search-for a lot of labelled data.

    Summary: Techniques to Prime the neural network with creating synthetic using a 3d generator are used. The resulting synthetic labelled data is used along with limited training data to show big improvements on all standard datasets. Further this is shown to be better than data augmentation. Software to generate such is made open source.
