    Summary: This paper talks about using data augmentation as a means to avoid a lot of data. Uses CNN of augemnted data. Tests finally of LFW (though clearly doesn't aim at beating the highest accuracies due to unavailablity of commercial achievers' resource details). But asserts it clearly provides an alternative to creating/search-for a lot of labelled data.
